# Configuration 

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration may not be complete and if missing will be added over time. Currently, display, logo as well as modules are supported.

Configuration documents are split into different files based on their name in the fastfetch configuration. Further changes will be added if and when the support changes or new things are added. <br>

General configuration in regards to the Nix framework can be found [here](./general.md).<br>

Logo configuration can be found [here](./logo.md).<br>

Display configuration can be found [here](./display.md).<br>

Module configuration for fastfetch can be found [here](./modules.md).<br>

All properties do include a default value which can be found in this Nix [module](../../modules/default-values.nix) or found in each configuration page.<br>

Example of nff being used can be found [here](../example.md).
